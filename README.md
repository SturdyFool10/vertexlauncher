## Our Goals
my goal is to make a launcher that:
- respects your privacy
- works cross-platform
- gets out of your way
- lets you use your system to its limits(probably RAM)
- does not ban you for being controversial / not being conformist
- allows power users to configure it to their liking
- is expandable enough to adapt to the future of Minecraft and modding
- allows you to do most everything that other launchers do short of becoming a client
- is lightweight and fast
- stable
- looks great while doing it all

## How we are going to achieve our goals

I will eventually implement the launcher using nothing but native code and native rendering APIs, such as Vulkan through WebGPU, which simplifies the process. Ads may run but I will not sell your data to enable the ads to be targeted towards users, this will come at a cost to the launcher's profitability, however, I think it is worth it. I will implement the UI in a way that functions well while looking great, and I will ensure that the launcher is stable and fast, even on older hardware so long as it supports Vulkan, which you will need in order to keep running Minecraft come next year sometime anyways, so the goal is that the launcher works wherever Minecraft runs. I also hope that some point I will be able to offer a "Prefer Integrated Graphics" option for the many of us with gaming pcs to hopefully make rendering happen on un-utilized hardware so the launcher gets out of the way while gaming
